# GeoStack Course
Welcome to the 10-day GeoStack Course!

**Folder Overview**
- Building-the-VM-from-scratch-using-the-manuals: contains the folders with the cookbooks and programming manuals and the subfolders for the course software.
- Building-the-VM-using-the-installation-scripts: the installations scripts to build the GeoStack quickly on an Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine.
- Course-Datasets: contains the folder structure to download datasets.


**Use**
- This repository folder is cloned in the GeoStack Course as instructed in the 'Cookbook-Creating-the_GeoStack-Course-VM' that is in the repository GeoStack-Manuals. 
  - This cookbook also has the instructions on how to download the required datasets, run the installation scripts and learn how to build and program the GeoStack from scratch. 
  - This cookbook can be download via the blue button 'Download Manuals' on the [GitHub home page of The GeoStack Project](https://The-GeoStack-Project.github.io).
- Tip: for beginners and experienced programmers alike the advice is to always build a GeoStack Virtual Machine with the installation scripts first and take a look at the scripts files to see how things work internally. 
  - In that way you learn quickly what the end result must be when building a VM from scratch.
  - Also, you can experiment quickly with the working web applications and (your own) datasets without having to learn how to program these web apps first!
